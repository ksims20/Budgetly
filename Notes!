Node.JS
Req.body – Gets data from the front end, whatever the user enters from the front end
Res.json(data) – Sends data back to the Front end
Await – Used as async operation (it takes time to get data from the database)

PRISMA

Migrate: prisma migrate dev –name init  (creates the migration folder)
Generate Client: npx prisma generate

Express
Makes sure that when data is sent back (in the form of JSON) that Express can read it
app.use(express.json());

Extras
What does your app do?
Your app is a budget tracker, so it needs to store data related to:
•	Income (money coming in)
•	Expenses (money going out)
What kind of information do you need to track?
For each transaction, you’d probably want to know:
•	What the transaction is (e.g., rent, groceries, salary)
•	How much money is involved
•	When the transaction happened
•	Whether it’s income or an expense
•	What category it falls under (food, bills, savings, etc.)
What would this look like in a database?
•	Each transaction needs a unique ID
•	A description of the transaction
•	An amount (money involved)
•	A date when it happened
•	A type (expense or income)
